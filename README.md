 Iris Flower Species Clustering using K-means Algorithm
'iris' dataset ,predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it 
Description:

In this project, I implemented the K-means clustering algorithm to classify Iris flower species based on their sepal length, sepal width, petal length,
and petal width measurements. The Iris dataset,
sourced from sklearn.datasets, contains 150 samples of Iris flowers, each labeled as setosa, versicolor, or virginica.



Results:

ARI Score: 0.73 (indicating a substantial agreement between true and predicted clusters)
NMI Score: 0.76 (suggesting a high level of clustering accuracy)
